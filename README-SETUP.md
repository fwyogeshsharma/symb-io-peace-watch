# SymbIOT Peace Watch - Setup Guide

## Overview
SymbIOT Peace Watch is a comprehensive senior care monitoring application with authentication, real-time sensor monitoring, health tracking, and caregiver support features.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite (Port: 8086)
- **Backend**: Express.js API (Port: 3001)
- **Database**: SQLite (peace-watch.db)

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode (Recommended)
Run both frontend and backend servers concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- Backend API server on http://localhost:3001
- Frontend Vite dev server on http://localhost:8086

### Run Individually
**Backend only:**
```bash
npm run server
```

**Frontend only:**
```bash
npm run client
```

## Demo Accounts

Three demo accounts are pre-seeded in the database:

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- React Router DOM
- TanStack Query
- Shadcn/ui Components
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide Icons

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- better-sqlite3
- bcryptjs (password hashing)
- cors

### Development
- Concurrently (run multiple servers)
- ESLint
- TypeScript ESLint

## Notes

- The database file `peace-watch.db` will be created automatically in the project root
- Demo data is automatically seeded on first run
- The frontend makes API calls to `http://localhost:3001/api`
- CORS is enabled for development

## Troubleshooting

**Ports already in use:**
- Backend uses port 3001
- Frontend will automatically find an available port (typically 8080-8090)

**Database errors:**
- Delete `peace-watch.db` file and restart to reset the database

**API connection errors:**
- Ensure the backend server is running on port 3001
- Check console for CORS errors

## Next Steps

You can extend the application by:
1. Adding more API endpoints for CRUD operations
2. Implementing WebSocket for real-time sensor data
3. Adding file upload for senior photos
4. Implementing QR code generation for shopping
5. Adding email/SMS notifications
6. Integrating with actual IoT devices
7. Building mobile apps using React Native
